##### Its everything DASH intended to be but different and without Masternodes

LITHE aims to study the best practices of the fiat world and work towards developing products to be user-friendly for the people. So even though people are using the LITHE crypto on the backend, they will have no problems interacting with it because of its elegent UI. LITHE is built upon the [TurtleCoin](https://github.com/turtlecoin/turtlecoin) network which has features such as [Light Blocks](https://blog.turtlecoin.lol/archives/the-quest-for-lightning-block-propagation/), [Private Transactions](https://cryptonote.org/inside#unlinkable-transaction) and [Blockchain Analysis Resistance](https://cryptonote.org/inside#blockchain-analysis-resistance). LITHE has a maximum supply of only 2.5 billion coins which means there would be enough coins constantly flowing within the network but not too many that you would have to use more coins than expected to purchase goods. We know of one minor problem between cryptocurrency and normal people, it is like black magic to them, LITHE will change that so even your grandma can have a wallet and she would still be able to buy them sweets for the grandkids just as easily as she would with her bank issued card. LITHE will be like the gateway to cryptocurrency in which it allows anyone and everyone the ability to benefit from it.

## Building LITHE

With the beauty of Open Software, you can build LITHE for yourself if you find it easier than running binaries. We have a variety of instructions so you're not short on how to do things for yourself.
