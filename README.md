# The Lithe Projectâ„¢ [![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/wyrlv56t71apinth?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/Lithe-Project/lithe)
##### Its everything DASH intended to be but different

LITHE aims to study the best practices of the fiat world and work towatds developing products to be user-friendly for the people. So even though people are using the LITHE crypto on the backend, they will have no problems interacting with it because of its elegent UI. LITHE is built upon the [TurtleCoin](https://github.com/turtlecoin/turtlecoin) network which has features like [Light Blocks](https://blog.turtlecoin.lol/archives/the-quest-for-lightning-block-propagation/), [Private Transactions](https://cryptonote.org/inside#unlinkable-transaction) and [Blockchain Analysis Resistance](https://cryptonote.org/inside#blockchain-analysis-resistance). LITHE only has a max supply of only 2.5 billion coins which means there is would be enough coins constantly flowing within the network but not too many that you would have to use more coins than expected to purchase.
